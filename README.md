# Basic operations with database

This project was created for the *Database systems* course at FIT BUT. 
The goal of this project was to get familiar with basic operations in SQL, including the creation of tables,
insertion of basic data values, and advanced selection of data adhering to a very detailed set of rules, thus
having to join multiple tables and making use of various conditional statements.

In the first phase of the project, detailed specification of the designed system was created together with
a corresponding *use case* and *entity relationship* diagrams. The purpose of the aformentioned system is the 
management of data in magical world of wizards, spells and broomsticks.

The further phases contain the developed sql script, each building upon the previous part. 
The complete script can be seen in **part4** folder.
